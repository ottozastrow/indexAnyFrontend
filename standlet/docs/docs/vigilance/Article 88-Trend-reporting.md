Article&nbsp;84.</p>
   <p class="norm">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The competent authorities may conduct 
their own assessments on the trend reports referred to in

measures in accordance with this Regulation in order to ensure the 
protection of public health and patient safety. Each competent authority
 shall inform the Commission, the other competent authorities and the 
notified body that issued the certificate, of the results of such 
assessment and of the adoption of such measures.</p>
