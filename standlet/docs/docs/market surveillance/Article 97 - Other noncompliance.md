unacceptable risk to the health or safety of patients, users or other 
persons, or to other aspects of the protection of public health, they 
shall require the relevant economic operator to bring the non-compliance
 concerned to an end within a reasonable period that is clearly defined 
and communicated to the economic operator and that is proportionate to 
the non-compliance.</p>

the product being made available on the market or to ensure that it is 
recalled or withdrawn from the market. That Member&nbsp;State shall 
inform the Commission and the other Member&nbsp;States, without delay, 
of those measures, by means of the electronic system referred to in
