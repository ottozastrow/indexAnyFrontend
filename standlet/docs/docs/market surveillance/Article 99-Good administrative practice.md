   <p class="norm">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any measure adopted by the competent 
authorities of the Member&nbsp;States pursuant to Articles&nbsp;95 to 98
 shall state the exact grounds on which it is based. Where such a 
measure is addressed to a specific economic operator, the competent 
authority shall notify without delay the economic operator concerned of 
that measure, and shall at the same time inform that economic operator 
of the remedies available under the law or the administrative practice 
of the Member&nbsp;State concerned and of the time limits to which such 
remedies are subject. Where the measure is of general applicability, it 
shall be appropriately published.</p>
   <p class="norm">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in cases where immediate action 
is necessary for reasons of unacceptable risk to human health or safety,
 the economic operator concerned shall be given the opportunity to make 
submissions to the competent authority within an appropriate period of 
time that is clearly defined before any measure is adopted.</p>
   <p class="norm">Where action has been taken without the economic 
operator having had the opportunity to make submissions as referred to 
in the first subparagraph, it shall be given the opportunity to make 
submissions as soon as possible and the action taken shall be reviewed 
promptly thereafter.</p>
   <p class="norm">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any measure adopted shall be 
immediately withdrawn or amended upon the economic operator's 
demonstrating that it has taken effective corrective action and that the
 device is in compliance with the requirements of this Regulation.</p>
   <p class="norm">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a measure adopted pursuant to 
Articles&nbsp;95 to 98 concerns a device for which a notified body has 
been involved in the conformity assessment, the competent authorities 
shall by means of the electronic system referred to in Article&nbsp;100 
inform the relevant notified body and the authority responsible for the 
notified body of the measure taken.</p>
