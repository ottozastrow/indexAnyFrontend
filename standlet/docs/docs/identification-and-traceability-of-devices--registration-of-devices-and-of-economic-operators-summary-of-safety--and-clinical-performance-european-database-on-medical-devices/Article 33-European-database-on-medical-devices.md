by the Member&nbsp;States, notified bodies, economic operators and

 than those referred to in Article&nbsp;10(8).</p>

 Directive&nbsp;95/46/EC, respectively. They shall also ensure that data
 subjects may effectively exercise the right of access to data relating 
to them, and the right to have inaccurate or incomplete data corrected 
and erased. Within their respective responsibilities, the Commission and
 the Member&nbsp;States shall ensure that inaccurate and unlawfully 
processed data are deleted, in accordance with the applicable 
legislation. Corrections and deletions shall be carried out as soon as 
possible, but no later than 60&nbsp;days after a request is made by a 
data subject.</p>
   <p class="norm">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission shall, by means of 
implementing acts, lay down the detailed arrangements necessary for the 
setting up and maintenance of Eudamed. Those implementing acts shall be 
adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in 
Article&nbsp;114(3). When adopting those implementing acts, the 
Commission shall ensure that, as far as possible, the system is 
developed in such a way as to avoid having to enter the same information
 twice within the same module or in different modules of the system.</p>
   <p class="norm">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to its responsibilities 
under this Article&nbsp;and the processing of personal data involved 
therein, the Commission shall be considered to be the controller of
