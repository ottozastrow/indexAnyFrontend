   <p class="norm">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;By means of the electronic system 
referred to in <a href='../CHAPTER VI/Article 73 - Electronic system on clinical investigations'> Article 73</a>, the sponsor of a clinical investigation

conducted acts as coordinating Member&nbsp;State. The Member&nbsp;States
 in which the clinical investigation is to be conducted shall, within 
six days of submission of the application, agree on one of them taking 
the role of the coordinating Member&nbsp;State. If they do not agree on a
 coordinating Member&nbsp;State, the coordinating Member&nbsp;State 
proposed by the sponsor shall assume that role.</p>

 Member&nbsp;State referred to in paragraph&nbsp;2, the

   <p class="norm">However, the completeness of the documentation 
referred to in Sections 1.13, 3.1.3, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter II of 
Annex&nbsp;XV shall be assessed separately by each Member&nbsp;State 
concerned in accordance with <a href='../CHAPTER VI/Article 70 - Application for clinical investigations'> Article 70</a>(1) to (5).</p>

assessment in the case of substantial modifications pursuant to 
paragraph&nbsp;12 of this Article, in the case of reporting of adverse 
events pursuant to <a href='../CHAPTER VI/Article 80 - Recording and reporting of adverse events that occur during clinical investigations'> Article 80</a>(4) and in the case of clinical 
investigations of combination products between medical devices and 
medicinal products, where the latter are under a concurrent coordinated 
assessment of a clinical trial under 
Regulation&nbsp;(EU)&nbsp;No&nbsp;536/2014. Those implementing acts
