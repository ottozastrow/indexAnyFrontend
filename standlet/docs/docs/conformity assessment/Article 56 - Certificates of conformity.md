           <p class="stitle-article-norm">Certificates of conformity</p>
   <p class="norm">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificates issued by the notified
 bodies in accordance with Annexes&nbsp;IX, X and XI shall be in an 
official Union language determined by the Member&nbsp;State in which the
 notified body is established or otherwise in an official Union language
 acceptable to the notified body. The minimum content of the 
certificates shall be as set out in Annex&nbsp;XII.</p>
   <p class="norm">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificates shall be valid for the
 period they indicate, which shall not exceed five years. On application
 by the manufacturer, the validity of the certificate may be extended 
for further periods, each not exceeding five years, based on a 
re-assessment in accordance with the applicable conformity assessment 
procedures. Any supplement to a certificate shall remain valid as long 
as the certificate which it supplements is valid.</p>
   <p class="norm">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notified bodies may impose restrictions
 to the intended purpose of a device to certain groups of patients or 
require manufacturers to undertake specific PMCF studies pursuant to 
Part B of Annex&nbsp;XIV.</p>
   <p class="norm">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a notified body finds that the 
requirements of this Regulation are no longer met by the manufacturer, 
it shall, taking account of the principle of proportionality, suspend or
 withdraw the certificate issued or impose any restrictions on it unless
 compliance with such requirements is ensured by appropriate corrective 
action taken by the manufacturer within an appropriate deadline set by 
the notified body. The notified body shall give the reasons for its 
decision.</p>
   <p class="norm">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The notified body shall enter in the 
electronic system referred to in Article&nbsp;57 any information 
regarding certificates issued, including amendments and supplements 
thereto, and regarding suspended, reinstated, withdrawn or refused 
certificates and restrictions imposed on certificates. Such information 
shall be accessible to the public.</p>
   <p class="norm">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of technical progress, the
 Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with 
Article&nbsp;115 amending the minimum content of the certificates set 
out in Annex&nbsp;XII.</p>
