           <p class="stitle-article-norm">Involvement of notified bodies in conformity assessment procedures</p>
   <p class="norm">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the conformity assessment 
procedure requires the involvement of a notified body, the manufacturer 
may apply to a notified body of its choice, provided that the chosen 
notified body is designated for conformity assessment activities related
 to the types of devices concerned. The manufacturer may not lodge an 
application in parallel with another notified body for the same 
conformity assessment procedure.</p>
   <p class="norm">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The notified body concerned shall, by 
means of the electronic system referred to in Article&nbsp;57, inform 
the other notified bodies of any manufacturer that withdraws its 
application prior to the notified body's decision regarding the 
conformity assessment.</p>
   <p class="norm">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;When applying to a notified body under 
paragraph&nbsp;1, manufacturers shall declare whether they have 
withdrawn an application with another notified body prior to the 
decision of that notified body and provide information about any 
previous application for the same conformity assessment that has been 
refused by another notified body.</p>
   <p class="norm">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The notified body may require any 
information or data from the manufacturer, which is necessary in order 
to properly conduct the chosen conformity assessment procedure.</p>
   <p class="norm">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notified bodies and the personnel of 
notified bodies shall carry out their conformity assessment activities 
with the highest degree of professional integrity and the requisite 
technical and scientific competence in the specific field and shall be 
free from all pressures and inducements, particularly financial, which 
might influence their judgement or the results of their conformity 
assessment activities, especially as regards persons or groups with an 
interest in the results of those activities.</p>
